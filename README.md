# Feedback

- **Was it easy to complete the task using AI?**  
  Yes, the AI was able to provide accurate and helpful responses that made it easier to complete the task.

- **How long did task take you to complete?**  
  The task took approximately 2-3q hours to complete.

- **Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?**  
  The code generated by the AI was mostly ready to run. I only had to make a few minor adjustments to fit my specific use case.

- **Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?**  
  The main challenge was understanding how to properly configure SonarQube and JaCoCo for code coverage analysis. The AI was able to provide clear instructions on how to do this.

- **Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?**  
  I learned that it's a good practice to use environment variables to store sensitive information like the SonarQube token. This keeps the sensitive information out of the code and makes it easier to change the values without having to modify the code.

# Todo Application

This is a simple Todo application built with ChatGPT. It allows users to manage their todo items.

## Features

- Create a new todo item
- Update an existing todo item
- Delete a todo item
- List all todo items

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Gradle
- SonarQube (optional)

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure your database settings. Open the `application.properties` file and set the following properties:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=your_database_url
spring.datasource.username=your_database_username
spring.datasource.password=your_database_password
```

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eshonkulov-asliddin/todo-app-with-gpt.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd todo-app-with-gpt
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running Tests

You can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Generating JaCoCo Report

You can generate a JaCoCo report with the following command:

```bash
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
```

The report will be generated in the `build/reports/jacoco/test` directory.

## Running SonarQube Analysis

Before running the SonarQube analysis, make sure you have SonarQube running and you have set the `SONAR_HOST_URL` and `SONAR_TOKEN` environment variables.

You can run the SonarQube analysis with the following command:

```bash
./gradlew jacocoTestReport sonarqube
```

The analysis results will be available on your SonarQube server.
